                  AcademiaHub was born from a simple observation: students
                  across different universities were struggling to access
                  quality research materials, while countless valuable academic
                  projects remained locked away in institutional archives.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Founded in 2025 by a group of graduate students, we set out to
                  create a platform that would break down these barriers. What
                  started as a small repository has grown into a thriving
                  community of researchers, students, and academics from over
                  100 institutions worldwide.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base lg:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Today, we&apos;re proud to facilitate knowledge sharing,
                  foster collaboration, and support the academic journeys of
                  thousands of students every day.
